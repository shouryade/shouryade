## Hi there 👋, I'm Shourya De

I'm a final year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.
Beyond the lines of code, you can find me engrossed in a good book or engaged in an intense game of table tennis. If I'm not answering calls, chances are I'm deeply immersed in a hackathon!  
Currently my projects range from full-stack web applications to AI/ML implementations.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 🤔  I am currently learning how to use Golang in production.
- ⚡ I am looking to collaborate more on open source projects and innovative ideas.
- 💬 Anything related to college ki padhai, backend dev or fun anecdotes!
