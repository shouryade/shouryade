## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shourya De

I'm a passionate software developer and aspiring AI enthusiast, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Thapar Institute of Engineering Technology.  
Beyond the lines of code, you can find me engrossed in a good book or engaged in an intense game of table tennis. If I'm not answering calls, chances are I'm deeply immersed in a hackathon!  
Currently my projects range from full-stack web applications to AI/ML implementations.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus
- â˜¸  I am currently learning how to use Kubernetes _effectively_.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking to collaborate more on open source projects and innovative ideas.
- ðŸ’¬ Anything related to college ki padhai, backend dev stuff or anything tech!
