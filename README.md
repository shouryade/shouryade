## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shourya De

I'm a pre-final year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.
Beyond the lines of code, you can find me engrossed in a good book or engaged in an intense game of table tennis. If I'm not answering calls, chances are I'm deeply immersed in a hackathon!  
Currently my projects range from full-stack web applications to AI/ML implementations.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus
- ðŸ¤”  I am currently learning how to use Redis _effectively_ to scale.
- âš¡ I am looking to collaborate more on open source projects and innovative ideas.
- ðŸ’¬ Anything related to college ki padhai, backend dev stuff or anything tech!
